Assignment 2: CONDA

I used the following steps to recreate Conda environments using the environmental file yml, then i downloaded the 2 files (software_dev_v1 and software_dev_v2) from this link: https://github.com/augustinh22/geo-software-dev/tree/main/A2 and it was moved to the required folder.

CREATING AND ACTIVATING THE ENVIRONMENT

I created and activated the environment software_dev_v1.yml by typing Conda create_name --name software_dev_v1.yml

I had a smooth process and no error code was encountered.
